# weather_app
A fully functional weather web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, PHP for server-side scripting, and MySQL for database management. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API, updates the database every 2 hours, and stores searched locations in the browser's local storage for quick access.
